In 1763, King George III of Great Britain granted John Ormsby, a soldier in the French and Indian War as well as the alleged first settler of Pittsburgh, 2,400 acres of land along the southern banks of the Monongahela River for his service in the capture of Fort Duquesne. Ormsby divided the land into four boroughs – South Pittsburgh, Birmingham, Ormsby, and East Birmingham, which is present day South Side Slopes.

South Side expanded and grew in order to keep up with Pittsburgh's industrial boom, adopting the nickname "Workshop of the World". The industry of glass-making was predominant in the early 1800s, and later the banks of the Monongahela River became home to the iron and steel operations run by the company J&L Steel.

J&L (The Jones and Laughlin Steel Company) eventually became South Side's largest employer as by 1910 it employed 15,000 workers.The majority of these workers came as immigrants from European nations such as Germany, Ireland, Poland, Lithuania, the Ukraine, and the Slavic nations and settled into homes in the present day South Side Slopes. The houses built for them were traditionally one room wide, two rooms deep, and up to four stories high. The houses are built into the hillside with narrow walkways between them. Most of the structures and houses in both South Side Slopes are balloon-framed whereas many of those on the South Side Flats were built from brick, in a rectangular fashion. Many of them were ornamented in the popular style of the 1900s – Romanesque, Italianate and Second Empire. They are fashioned in a classical Victorian style row home way with carved doorways, cornices, corbelling, cast iron ornaments and geometric slate patterns. 

The Slopes is rich in culture as many immigrants wanted to preserve their native cultures and languages; so they built many bars and churches, many of which still exist today.

The Southside slopes is one of Pittsburgh's original blue collar neighborhoods. 

Per Wikipedia

The slopes are only walkable  to people who enjoy  steep hills and lots of steps.

Most people in the slopes  prefer Uber or Lyft which  both service the area. 


The slopes are definitely  close enough  to Carson St fun by Uber or Lyft but far enough  away to enjoy a neighborhood feel. This location is very  convenient  to everything Pittsburgh.

**sounds of the city notice ** this home is a duplex  in a dense  urban  area.  You will hear the neighbors  since their home shares  walls  with your  Airbnb. This is also the city so you will hear sounds  of the city.  You will  hear  trains,  planes,  automobiles,  busses,  fire trucks, ambulances, police cars, helicopters, people, and wildlife  from the Southside  Park  which  is directly  in front of  your Airbnb.  

If you are noise  sensitive  please  keep  this in mind  prior  to booking  this Airbnb. 

To fully enjoy the Roku streaming player make sure you bring all your favorite stations log in information for your  viewing pleasure. 

The slopes are not the flats. This is not a walkable  location  for most people. You will probably  want to Uber/Lyft  to Carson  St.  or other points of interest in the city. Please  keep this in mind  prior  to booking with us.

Our Airbnb features a Nectar memory foam mattress.  Memory foam mattresses tend to be on the firmer side and are not for everyone.  If you are not totally comfortable with memory foam mattresses this might not be the best Airbnb for you.

Even though our Airbnb is refreshed it is not modern or new. It is a older Southside slopes home in one of Pittsburgh's original blue collar neighborhoods.  You will find nice updates as well as older home quirks.

Quiet Hours
9pm-7am, daily. As with most communities, please keep music, movies, or other noise to a conversational level during the quiet hours.

Noise Monitoring
To ensure we’re being good neighbors, this suite is equipped with a noise sensor that measures decibels. There is no recording of audio, the device is active 24/7 and is located in the living area. If the noise exceeds a reasonable level, our Trust and Safety team will receive a notification and message you. To comply with community regulations, if the noise sensor becomes disconnected we will notify you if we need access to your stay to reconnect it.

We’re Here for You
Please do not contact building staff. While our property partners know you’re staying with us, they will be unable to help with questions or concerns.

Parties are Not Allowed
Disturbing other residents in this building will not be tolerated. While a rare occurrence, following warnings from your host triggered by the noise sensor or a complaint from a neighbor, you may be asked to leave at your own expense. Local law enforcement will be utilized if necessary.

No Smoking
We are a smoke-free community. No smoking also includes vaping devices and candles. This goes for balconies and in or around the building too. If evidence of smoking is found, a $500 fine will be assessed.

No Pets
Pets are not allowed. We likely would love your pet, but there will be a $500 fine for having a pet in the suite if not required by local regulations.

Professional Photo and Video Shoots
Commercial shoots of any kind will not be tolerated. While we do encourage showcasing your stay on social media, chances are, if you are using professional equipment or your content will make a profit, it’s not allowed.

Mind the keys
The lockbox must remain locked at all times (if applicable). Some stays have auto-locking doors so keep the keys on you. If the keys are lost or unreturned a fee of up to $300 dollars will be assessed. A $75 fee will be assessed for overnight lockout service.

Packages and Mail Delivery
Please do not send anything to the suite. We are not responsible for receiving, lost, or undelivered packages.

Guests and Events
The number of guests must match the number of guests on your reservation. If you are anticipating more people please updated your reservation and confirm by messaging our city team prior to their arrival. Building events and celebrations are for permanent residents of this property only and not open to attending

Third-Party Bookings
The name on the reservation must be the guest present for the duration of the stay. Some booking platforms may have additional restrictions, please refer to your reservation.

Excessive Cleaning
Enjoy your stay, but be mindful of the cleanup. We employ a professional cleaning staff adhering to OSHA and CDC guidelines to make sure your stay is clean and comfortable. However, if it takes our staff longer than 2 hours to clean after your visit a $75 fee will be assessed., security_deposit_native=0, security_price_native=0, security_deposit_formatted=$0, description=All Frontdesk stays are contactless self-check-in and include Scout, our exclusive digital companion to guide you through everything you'll need before and during your time with us.

Overlooking downtown Pittsburgh this historic neighborhood is a five minute drive or 15 min walk down the 18th st steps to all of the bars, restaurants and shopping in happening South Side and downtown Pittsburgh. This brand new studio apartment while being so close to all of the great amenities Pittsburgh has to offer is located in a quiet neighborhood steps from one of the best views the city has to offer.

As you enter the unfinished basement there is a finished cozy studio apartment on your right and a brand new private bathroom to your left. The studio itself is small but perfect for one or two travelers looking to spend their days exploring the city. There is a twin daybed with twin trundle underneath. We offer a small microwave for heating up leftovers, a two person coffee pot and a mini fridge. There is also a flat screen tv with Netflix, a comfortable dining area for two and a newly renovated bathroom with tiled shower. There are guests upstairs so there is a possibility for noise. Also, the control for the temperature is upstairs and governed by the guests up there. We do provide a fan and a space heater. 
Please note this is a finished room and bathroom in an otherwise unfinished basement. As such the floor is uneven, the ceiling height is low and the immediate entry area is only partially finished.

The laundry room off of the furnished bedroom is for owner use only.

We are available via Airbnb messenger between the hours of 9am and 10pm. We typically respond within one hour during these hours.

Groceries can be found locally at the Giant Eagle or Aldi's. For a nice dinner however we highly recommend Dish.  It's a hidden gem only locals know about.  Primantis and Fat Heads are local favorites for a sandwich. For a little fun and fitness Ascend rock climbing gym or BYS Yoga is also nearby.  For live music the Rex Theatre or Club Café are awesome options in the South Side. For fans of dive bars every local has a story to share from Jacks.  Big Dog coffee is my favorite cafe nearby and Doce is my spot for tacos. If you're you’d like to catch the “T” Station Square is a quick drive and has parking. From there you can head downtown or to the North Shore for games and concerts.  We are ten minutes from everything downtown and the North Shore has to offer.  We have biked along the river from South Side to downtown and North Shore and back which is a good time.

There is a bus stop one block from the apartment. You can walk the 18th st steps to all of the fun shops, bars and restaurants on Carson st.

Smoking (or vaping) is absolutely forbidden anywhere in the apartment; the building has smoke sensors and a sprinkler system. Smoking is allowed outside on the grounds. A minimum $1,000 cleaning fee will apply if smoking is discovered inside; if sprinklers are activated due to smoking, the guest will be responsible for all costs associated with remediation.

2. People other than those in the Guest party may not stay overnight in the property. Any other person in the property is the sole responsibility of Guest. The Host has not represented this unit as an event facility, therefore, additional guests are not permitted without prior notice. At no time may any of these visitors remain overnight or assume any guest privileges whatsoever.

3. The Host is not responsible for any accidents, injuries or illness that occurs while on the premises or its facilities. The Host is not responsible for the loss of personal belongings or valuables of the guest. By accepting this reservation, it is agreed that all guests are expressly assuming the risk of any harm arising from their use of the premises or others whom they invite to use the premise.

4. The Host allows children with the following stipulations: - Guests are responsible for any and all necessary 'baby proofing'. Children must be supervised by an adult at all times.

5. There is no daily housekeeping service. While the apartment has been thoroughly cleaned prior to your arrival and linens and bath towels are included, daily maid service is not included in the rate.

6. Pets are not permitted; any pet being "snuck" into the building will result in a minimum $300 cleaning fee to restore the apartment to a "pet free" living space. ESAs are considered pets by Airbnb.

7. Cleaning fees are paid to assure Guest's arrival to a clean property, not to clean up post-checkout "messes." While we don't ask or expect Guests to deep clean prior to leaving, we do expect reasonable cleanliness standards followed - garbage thrown away, spills cleaned up, etc. Cleaning required due to messiness will result in additional costs, charge at a rate of $35/hour.

8. Please return the parking pass upon check-out. Failure to return the pass will result in a $50 replacement fee.

9. Check out is at or before 11am. Late checkouts will be charged at $49 in 1/2 hour increments, as our cleaners are punctual and late checkouts affect their schedule, requiring us to call in last minute help.

10. Finally - this is not a hotel. Residents live here, too, and we expect you to live peacefully with neighbors. We aren't strict and want you to enjoy your time with us - just be respectful! This is a community of great people - we just ask that you don't act rude or entitled., security_deposit_native=0, security_price_native=0, security_deposit_formatted=$0, description=Luxury living downtown!

Quiet Hours
9pm-7am, daily. As with most communities, please keep music, movies, or other noise to a conversational level during the quiet hours.

Noise Monitoring
To ensure we’re being good neighbors, this suite is equipped with a noise sensor that measures decibels. There is no recording of audio, the device is active 24/7 and is located in the living area. If the noise exceeds a reasonable level, our Trust and Safety team will receive a notification and message you. To comply with community regulations, if the noise sensor becomes disconnected we will notify you if we need access to your stay to reconnect it.

We’re Here for You
Please do not contact building staff. While our property partners know you’re staying with us, they will be unable to help with questions or concerns.

Parties are Not Allowed
Disturbing other residents in this building will not be tolerated. While a rare occurrence, following warnings from your host triggered by the noise sensor or a complaint from a neighbor, you may be asked to leave at your own expense. Local law enforcement will be utilized if necessary.

No Smoking
We are a smoke-free community. No smoking also includes vaping devices and candles. This goes for balconies and in or around the building too. If evidence of smoking is found, a $500 fine will be assessed.

No Pets
Pets are not allowed. We likely would love your pet, but there will be a $500 fine for having a pet in the suite if not required by local regulations.

Professional Photo and Video Shoots
Commercial shoots of any kind will not be tolerated. While we do encourage showcasing your stay on social media, chances are, if you are using professional equipment or your content will make a profit, it’s not allowed.

Mind the keys
The lockbox must remain locked at all times (if applicable). Some stays have auto-locking doors so keep the keys on you. If the keys are lost or unreturned a fee of up to $300 dollars will be assessed. A $75 fee will be assessed for overnight lockout service.

Packages and Mail Delivery
Please do not send anything to the suite. We are not responsible for receiving, lost, or undelivered packages.

Guests and Events
The number of guests must match the number of guests on your reservation. If you are anticipating more people please updated your reservation and confirm by messaging our city team prior to their arrival.

At Frontdesk, a core value is to be a good neighbor. We extend this 5-star stay to you, our guests, as well as our property partners. This means we have a zero-tolerance policy for parties or gatherings. To ensure this in the most comfortable and least intrusive way possible, we use a noise sensor to detect the noise level inside of the suite. The number of people inside the suite may not exceed the reserved guest amount at any time. While we do not anticipate the need, following multiple warnings, we will utilize local law enforcement to ensure compliance. If removal is required, it will be done at the guest's expense.

Quiet Hours
9pm-7am, daily. As with most communities, please keep music, movies, or other noise to a conversational level during the quiet hours.

Noise Monitoring
To ensure we’re being good neighbors, this suite is equipped with a noise sensor that measures decibels. There is no recording of audio, the device is active 24/7 and is located in the living area. If the noise exceeds a reasonable level, our Trust and Safety team will receive a notification and message you. To comply with community regulations, if the noise sensor becomes disconnected we will notify you if we need access to your stay to reconnect it.

We’re Here for You
Please do not contact building staff. While our property partners know you’re staying with us, they will be unable to help with questions or concerns.

Parties are Not Allowed
Disturbing other residents in this building will not be tolerated. While a rare occurrence, following warnings from your host triggered by the noise sensor or a complaint from a neighbor, you may be asked to leave at your own expense. Local law enforcement will be utilized if necessary.

No Smoking
We are a smoke-free community. No smoking also includes vaping devices and candles. This goes for balconies and in or around the building too. If evidence of smoking is found, a $500 fine will be assessed.

No Pets
Pets are not allowed. We likely would love your pet, but there will be a $500 fine for having a pet in the suite if not required by local regulations.

Professional Photo and Video Shoots
Commercial shoots of any kind will not be tolerated. While we do encourage showcasing your stay on social media, chances are, if you are using professional equipment or your content will make a profit, it’s not allowed.

Mind the keys
The lockbox must remain locked at all times (if applicable). Some stays have auto-locking doors so keep the keys on you. If the keys are lost or unreturned a fee of up to $300 dollars will be assessed. A $75 fee will be assessed for overnight lockout service.

Packages and Mail Delivery
Please do not send anything to the suite. We are not responsible for receiving, lost, or undelivered packages.

Guests and Events
The number of guests must match the number of guests on your reservation. If you are anticipating more people please updated your reservation and confirm by messaging our city team prior to their arrival. Building events and celebrations are for permanent residents of this property only and not open to attending

Third-Party Bookings
The name on the reservation must be the guest present for the duration of the stay. Some booking platforms may have additional restrictions, please refer to your reservation.

Excessive Cleaning
Enjoy your stay, but be mindful of the cleanup. We employ a professional cleaning staff adhering to OSHA and CDC guidelines to make sure your stay is clean and comfortable. However, if it takes our staff longer than 2 hours to clean after your visit a $75 fee will be assessed., security_deposit_native=0, security_price_native=0, security_deposit_formatted=$0, description=All Frontdesk stays are contactless self-check-in and include Scout, our exclusive digital companion to guide you through everything you'll need before and during your time with us.

At Frontdesk, a core value is to be a good neighbor. We extend this 5-star stay to you, our guests, as well as our property partners. This means we have a zero-tolerance policy for parties or gatherings. To ensure this in the most comfortable and least intrusive way possible, we use a noise sensor to detect the noise level inside of the suite. The number of people inside the suite may not exceed the reserved guest amount at any time. While we do not anticipate the need, following multiple warnings, we will utilize local law enforcement to ensure compliance. If removal is required, it will be done at the guest's expense.

Quiet Hours
9pm-7am, daily. As with most communities, please keep music, movies, or other noise to a conversational level during the quiet hours.

Noise Monitoring
To ensure we’re being good neighbors, this suite is equipped with a noise sensor that measures decibels. There is no recording of audio, the device is active 24/7 and is located in the living area. If the noise exceeds a reasonable level, our Trust and Safety team will receive a notification and message you. To comply with community regulations, if the noise sensor becomes disconnected we will notify you if we need access to your stay to reconnect it.

We’re Here for You
Please do not contact building staff. While our property partners know you’re staying with us, they will be unable to help with questions or concerns.

Parties are Not Allowed
Disturbing other residents in this building will not be tolerated. While a rare occurrence, following warnings from your host triggered by the noise sensor or a complaint from a neighbor, you may be asked to leave at your own expense. Local law enforcement will be utilized if necessary.

No Smoking
We are a smoke-free community. No smoking also includes vaping devices and candles. This goes for balconies and in or around the building too. If evidence of smoking is found, a $500 fine will be assessed.

No Pets

Professional Photo and Video Shoots
Commercial shoots of any kind will not be tolerated. While we do encourage showcasing your stay on social media, chances are, if you are using professional equipment or your content will make a profit, it’s not allowed.

Mind the keys
The lockbox must remain locked at all times (if applicable). Some stays have auto-locking doors so keep the keys on you. If the keys are lost or unreturned a fee of up to $300 dollars will be assessed. A $75 fee will be assessed for overnight lockout service.

Quiet Hours
9pm-7am, daily. As with most communities, please keep music, movies, or other noise to a conversational level during the quiet hours.

Noise Monitoring
To ensure we’re being good neighbors, this suite is equipped with a noise sensor that measures decibels. There is no recording of audio, the device is active 24/7 and is located in the living area. If the noise exceeds a reasonable level, our Trust and Safety team will receive a notification and message you. To comply with community regulations, if the noise sensor becomes disconnected we will notify you if we need access to your stay to reconnect it.

We’re Here for You
Please do not contact building staff. While our property partners know you’re staying with us, they will be unable to help with questions or concerns.

Parties are Not Allowed
Disturbing other residents in this building will not be tolerated. While a rare occurrence, following warnings from your host triggered by the noise sensor or a complaint from a neighbor, you may be asked to leave at your own expense. Local law enforcement will be utilized if necessary.

No Smoking
We are a smoke-free community. No smoking also includes vaping devices and candles. This goes for balconies and in or around the building too. If evidence of smoking is found, a $500 fine will be assessed.

No Pets
Pets are not allowed. We likely would love your pet, but there will be a $500 fine for having a pet in the suite if not required by local regulations.

Professional Photo and Video Shoots
Commercial shoots of any kind will not be tolerated. While we do encourage showcasing your stay on social media, chances are, if you are using professional equipment or your content will make a profit, it’s not allowed.

Mind the keys
The lockbox must remain locked at all times (if applicable). Some stays have auto-locking doors so keep the keys on you. If the keys are lost or unreturned a fee of up to $300 dollars will be assessed. A $75 fee will be assessed for overnight lockout service.

Packages and Mail Delivery

Located near West Penn and Children's hospitals.
 Walking distance to Allegheny central park, groceries and bars/restaurants. 
You will have access to one bedroom (and optional kid's bedroom ) living area,  kitchen (and the basement bedroom if needed, plus washer/dryer area)
PLEASE BE AWARE: staircase that goes from first to a second floor is pretty steep and narrow and takes extra caution to walk on.
TV: Is a wall projector.

the best part about the place is that it's full of light and have a mini forest surrounding it from two sides.
 little backyard with a fireplace. 
and a tree swing.
Instead of TV I have a projector that you can hook to your laptop or cast from the phone, as well as a powerful sound system.

guests can use pretty much any place in the house.
 though I would ask a separate notice in case if someone has more than two guests and  wants to use kids bedroom or a basement bedroom (so I can prepare them to use), as they are not listed but they both have beds, and basement has a private full bathroom also (in case livingroom and main bedroom won't fit everyone)

I will be available by phone at any time.
Best is to call, as texts are usually on a silent mode.

walking distance to a central street of the neighborhood. huge old park for walks. neighborhood is pretty quiet day and night.

bus stop is about 5 minutes away walking.

be ready to a very steep and narrow staircase leading to a second floor (by ready I mean don't be drunk and have enough strength in your legs) - ALWAYS HOLD TO THE RAILS.
